# Blacksmith

## A fast, easy-to-use, and powerful replacement for CurseForge


Blacksmith is a powerful, light-weight Minecraft mod/modpack manager. It is made with Modpack Developers in mind.

Blacksmith has Quality of Life features, is easy to use, and can do everything other mod managers can do.

## Why would I use Blacksmith over something like CurseForge or MultiMC?

Simple, Blacksmith is faster, and more powerful. Ever scroll through the mod list and start freezing on CurseForge? Gone. Don't want to have to download Overwolf to use CurseForge? Use Blacksmith. You remove 1 mod and end up removing 15 others? Sounds like you should switch to Blacksmith.

Blacksmith is also built to be easy to use. You don't have to fiddle with JVM arguments just to run your game optimally, Blacksmith does all of that for you. Of course, if you're a more advanced user, you can always change stuff yourself!

Blacksmith is also completely open-source!


# Features List

1. Default optimized JVM arguments!
2. Automatically calibrate memory allocation for your PC, with options for those who want to use less memory.
3. Easy mod installation AND Deletion!
4. High performance & Lightweight!
5. Export and import modpacks!
6. Download modpacks from CurseForge!
7. Make your modpack public on CurseForge!

Still not convinced? Well, Blacksmith is completely free! You can always try it and switch back to something like MultiMC if you don't like it.
